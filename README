Library wrapping Globus Toolkit. This is intentionally written by hand and not
with SWIG, to make it easy to develop and audit the specific functionality
required by GO.

Currently only supports the loading and verifying certificate chains and proxy
files, by wrapping globus_gsi_credential. For example:

    import glopy

    c = glopy.Credential()
    c.load_cert_file("/tmp/x509up_u1000")
    print "subject =", c.get_subject()
    print "goodtill =", c.get_goodtill()
    try:
        c.verify_chain()
    except glopy.error as e:
        print "Verify Failed:", str(e)
    else:
        print "Verify OK"

A single credential object can be re-used to load and verify many certificates
and proxies, from files and from strings, within a single thread. However it is
not thread safe, so each thread should have it's own object.

Note: There are currently lots of warnings from gt header files. It would
be nice to fix these, I may be including a header twice.
